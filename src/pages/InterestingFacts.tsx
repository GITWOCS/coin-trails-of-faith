                  Some Crusader-era coins featured inscriptions in multiple languages, reflecting the 
                  cultural diversity and practical realities of Mediterranean societies.

                  The Norman kings of Sicily issued coins with inscriptions in Arabic, Greek, and Latin, 
                  reflecting the island's multicultural population and complex political identity.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Counterfeit coins were a significant issue during the Crusades era, with various 
                  methods used to create fake currency or debase official coinage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some medieval counterfeiters would create copper cores and coat them with gold 
                  or silver, a practice called "fourr√©e" that required sophisticated techniques.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  Several powerful women appeared on coinage during the Crusades era, reflecting their 
                  important political roles in both Christian and Muslim societies.

                <p>
                  Queen Melisende of Jerusalem (ruled 1131-1153) was one of the few female rulers whose 
                  name appeared on Crusader coinage, signifying her legitimate authority.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  The Crusades era saw important developments in coin minting technology, with cross-cultural 
                  exchange of techniques between European and Islamic societies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While European mints typically used hammered techniques for coinage, some Islamic mints 
                  had developed more advanced methods for ensuring consistent weight and purity.
